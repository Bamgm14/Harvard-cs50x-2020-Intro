# Digimon

## Description

This is a project that merges my prior knowledge of Python with the new knowledge I gained in the CS50 2020 Harvard Course on Introduction to Computer Science. 

It uses sockets to connect around.

## Installation
For the python server, you will need sqlite3 and an open port with static IP.

This is mainly for the server.

The android application must then be given these values before it can be deployed.

## Usage

First, one must run the Connector.py file to start up the sockets server with proper port binding and ip address. 

One can start the android application which will set itself up
